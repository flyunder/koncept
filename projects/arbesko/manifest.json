If you choose one of the alternate locations from below the map (which is an accordion style widget) the map would animate and show the new location. On the right side of things is a small introductory widget to the store locator, hitta butik!, and a bit of text about the contact form. I'm thinking if desired, the user can click on the link to open a small popup with a form to contact various departments."

I thought I would expand on that to bring the site more in-line with social media and interacting with customers over the web, to provide a more offical \"Ask Arbesko\" component of the blog where people can ask questions and receive answers in a blog form. The blog system will also, as you desired, act-as/replace the news system. So you can create simple news posts to update everyone on certain things (such as a new product) within the same system as sharing a video or answering an \"Ask Arbesko\" question. "
